Let's look at importing some more data, this time from a dataset called gapminder.

We can read in this dataset with the following command:
```{r}
library(readr)
gapminder <- read_delim(file = "datasets/02_gapminder.txt", delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

But how did I know which arguments to provide?

**Help Files**

We can access the help file for any function with:
```{r}
help(read_delim)
```

The help information shows up in the Help tab of your RStudio window.

**Note:** Commonly-used arguments in commonly-used functions quickly become familiar. But because R can do so much, even expeRts refer to the help system all the time when coding; no-one learns every detail of every function
